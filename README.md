## Error response :x:

This API tries to make use of a standardized mediatype called `application/problem+json`. You should expect this for all
the errors in the range 400-4xx.
```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 07 Aug 2019 10:10:06 GMT
```

```json
{
    "type": "https://example.com/v1/movies/78",
    "title": "Not authorized to view movie details",
    "status": 401,
    "detail": "Due to privacy concerns you are not allowed to view account details of others.",
    "instance": "/error/123456/details"
}
```

## Adding new environment variables :palm_tree:

This application makes use of a file with `.env` extension. Apart from that, the file `settings.go` is responsible for reading that file and converting it into a structure that can be used in the codebase.

Using the [mapstructure](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mitchellh/mapstructure) module we can convert the data from the .env file directly into the data types we find more useful (string to bool, for example). Using the tag available this module exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary Go type into another.

Adding a new variable resolves into just one new line of code. :smile:



## Rate Limiter

We make use of the module `golang.org/x/time/rate` which implements a _token-bucket_ rate-limiter algorithm.

The main idea is:

1. We will have a bucket that starts with b tokens in it.
2. Each time we receive a HTTP request, we will remove one token from the bucket.
3. Every 1/`r` seconds, a token is added back to the bucket â€” up to a maximum of b total
tokens.
4. If we receive a HTTP request and the bucket is empty, then we should return a
`429 Too Many Requests` response.

A simple curl command can test this limiter

```
for i in {1..6}; do curl <host>/v1/healthcheck; done
```

## Running locally :house:

You can start the database dependecy as a Docker container by running the following command:

```
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yaml" up -d --build
```

This will configure the databse and necessary tables. Also the `adminer` container allows you to have access to an UI to query/modify the database easily.
